## Concept
>![jDIVA concept](./templates/about/diva_concept.svg)

>The jdiva library follows a hierarchical and modular structure. At the top of the structure is the `ComposedImpactModel`, a data structure that contains several `LocalCoastalImpactModels`. Each `LocalCoastalImpactModel` consists of an 'exposure' module and a 'scenario' module. The main data structure behind the 'exposure' module is the `HypsometricProfile`. This data structure not only holds the elevation variable of the model but also connects elevation with certain assets, such as population and monetary assets. The 'scenario' module, on the other hand, handles future socio-economic and/or sea level rise scenarios in the form of distributions or by using implemented SLR-/SSP-wrappers.
