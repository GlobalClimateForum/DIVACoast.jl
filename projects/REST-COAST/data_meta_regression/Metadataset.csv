The area outside the dikes is enlarged by placing the Klimaatdijken more inland, (considering urban areas) to create a strip of land subject to tide and sedimentation. Here wetlands will (re-)establish, providing the opportunity of recreation, contributing to the storm buffering capacity and also support plant and animal populations by supporting the local ecosystem. Opening the Haringvlietdam will also influence the Voordelta (i.e. parts of Haringvlietdelta beyond the dam and adjacent coastal area), which is why this area was also included in the investigation.

Opening it will require removal of this dam (see Fig. 6). This will reintroduce tide in the whole area up to the Biesbosch. From the west salt water will enter a part of the area, while freshwater from the rivers will flow through the arm to the sea. The freshwater-saltwater gradient is restored. The location of this gradient zone will depend on theamount of fresh water that will flow in, but will occur mostly in the west area of the Haringvliet. Triggered by tide erosion and sedimentation processes will form channels and islands again. The shallow zones along the dikes will rise because of sedimentation and wetlands will develop here. Figure 5 shows the current and a future scenario of how the Haringvliet could be developed with restored estuarine dynamics. It should be underlined that this map shows a global, possible future scenario that formed input for this research. The actual future development can differ from this scenario. Current dikes have insufficient height and can be replaced by ?Klimaatdijken? (climate dikes) which are dikes that are unusually broad and because of their large area and slope provide opportunity for functions like recreation, residence and agriculture. The area outside the dikes is enlarged by placing the Klimaatdijken more inland, (considering urban areas) to create a strip of land subject to tide and sedimentation.
